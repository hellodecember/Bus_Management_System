# Bus_Management_System
A program to simulate a Bus Reservation System. The goal of this simulation is to add in new bus lines, allow users to see available buses, and make reservations. A bus line consists of a bus number, a driver, depart and arrival destinations, and departure and arrival times. Each bus can seat up to 32 passangers and users can pick their seat of any available. If a user tries to reserve a seat already taken, the system will not let them. If a user tries to make a reservation on a bus already full, it won't let them. Users can also look up the current reservation status of a particular bus line if it exists. If it does not exist, the system will put them back at the main menu to try a different bus line number. After making a reservation, the user can look up the bus line to confirm for themselves that the reservation worked. After completing what they needed to to, the user can safely exit the program.
